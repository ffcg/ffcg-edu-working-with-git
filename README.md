# Working with Git

Write some nice intro here.

## Getting started

Clone the repo.

## Usage

The scripts ***require*** that you run them from the directory where they are located since paths in the scripts are relative.

```bash
cd <season>
./<episode>.sh
cd <episode>
```

Then do some nice gitting in the repo that was created.

*NB:* Some scripts will create a remote repo next to ```<episode>``` directory called ```<episode>-remote.git```
